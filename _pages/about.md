Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in the College of Computer Science and Technology at China University of Petroleum (East China) supervised by [Xun Wang](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/_s104/_t1903/2023/0727/c20895a409285/page.psp) and [Tao Song](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/_s104/_t1903/2023/0727/c20895a409285/page.psp). My research focuses on high-performance computing systems, machine learning systems, and bio-inspired AI algorithms.
