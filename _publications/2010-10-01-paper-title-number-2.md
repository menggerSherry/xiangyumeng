excerpt: 'This paper proposes TransFusionNet, a novel deep learning framework for fine-grained segmentation of liver tumors and vessels in CT images. The network integrates semantic, local spatial, and edge feature extraction with multi-scale feature fusion, and leverages transfer learning to enhance segmentation accuracy. In addition, an intelligent quantization scheme is introduced to enable efficient and high-performance inference on edge devices such as Jetson TX2. Experimental results demonstrate that TransFusionNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy while effectively addressing the trade-off between precision and computational efficiency.'
