excerpt: 'This paper proposes Gene-MOE, a novel sparsely gated framework for cancer diagnosis and prognosis that leverages mixture-of-expert (MOE) and the newly designed mixture of attention expert (MOAE) layers. By integrating pan-cancer information from 33 cancer types via pre-training, the model effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances prediction accuracy. Gene-MOE achieves state-of-the-art performance in survival analysis (best concordance index on 12 of 14 cancer types), cancer classification (95.8% accuracy across 33 cancer types), and cancer subtyping (outperforming on key metrics in 7 of 9 cancers). These results demonstrate its strong potential for precise cancer genomic analysis and clinical applications.'
